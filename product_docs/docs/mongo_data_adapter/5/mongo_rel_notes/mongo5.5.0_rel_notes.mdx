include:

| Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature     | Push down `ORDER BY` to remote MongoDB servers: If possible push the `ORDER BY` clause to the remote MongoDB server. This approach provides the ordered result set from the foreign server, which can help to have an efficient merge join.    |
| Feature     | Push down `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` to remote MongoDB servers: Where possible, perform `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` operations on the remote server. This reduces network traffic between local Postgres and remote MongoDB servers.                            |
| Enhancement | Improved the WHERE clause pushdown to remote MongoDB servers: Now supports recursive operator expressions, Boolean expressions, relabel types, and vars on both sides of an operator.                                                          |
| Bug Fix     | For nested join queries, save the status of the `enable_aggregate_pushdown` option to access the aggregation path later.                                                                                                                       |
| Bug Fix     | Fix server crash due to missing `Param` node handling.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Bug Fix     | Fix typos in `autogen.sh` and `README.md` files.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
