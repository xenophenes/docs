The configuration parameters in this section control resource usage through EDB Resource Manager.

## edb_max_resource_groups

**Parameter type:** Integer

**Default value:** 16

**Range:** 0 to 65536

**Minimum scope of effect:** Cluster

**When value changes take effect:** Restart

**Required authorization to activate:** EPAS service account

This parameter controls the maximum number of resource groups that can be used simultaneously by EDB Resource Manager. More resource groups can be created than the value specified by `edb_max_resource_groups`, however, the number of resource groups in active use by processes in these groups cannot exceed this value.

Parameter `edb_max_resource_groups` should be set comfortably larger than the number of groups you expect to maintain so as not to run out.

## edb_resource_group

**Parameter type:** String

**Default value:** none

**Range:** n/a

**Minimum scope of effect:** Per session

**When value changes take effect:** Immediate

**Required authorization to activate:** Session user

Set the `edb_resource_group` parameter to the name of the resource group to which the current session is to be controlled by EDB Resource Manager according to the groupâ€™s resource type settings.

If the parameter is not set, then the current session does not utilize EDB Resource Manager.
