Specifies the target of checkpoint completion as a fraction of total time between checkpoints. This spreads out the checkpoint writes while the system starts working towards the next checkpoint.

The default of 0.5 means aim to finish the checkpoint writes when 50% of the next checkpoint is ready. A value of 0.9 means aim to finish the checkpoint writes when 90% of the next checkpoint is done, thus throttling the checkpoint writes over a larger amount of time and avoiding spikes of performance bottlenecking.
