## Name

`DROP DIRECTORY` -- remove a directory alias for a file system directory path.

## Synopsis

```text
DROP DIRECTORY <name>
```

## Description

`DROP DIRECTORY` drops an existing alias for a file system directory path that was created with the `CREATE DIRECTORY` command. To execute this command you must be a superuser.

When a directory alias is deleted, the corresponding physical file system directory is not affected. The file system directory must be deleted using the appropriate operating system commands.

## Parameters

`name`

 The name of a directory alias to be removed.

## Examples

Remove the directory alias named `empdir`:

```text
DROP DIRECTORY empdir;
```
