title: "Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers: SQL"

This guide provides a summary of the SQL commands compatible with Oracle databases that are supported by EDB Postgres Advanced Server. The SQL commands in this section will work on both an Oracle database and an EDB Postgres Advanced Server database.

Note the following points:

-   EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports other commands that are not listed here. These commands may have no Oracle equivalent or they may provide the similar or same functionality as an Oracle SQL command, but with different syntax.
-   The SQL commands in this section don't necessarily represent the full syntax, options, and functionality available for each command. In most cases, syntax, options, and functionality that are not compatible with Oracle databases have been omitted from the command description and syntax.
-   The EDB Postgres Advanced Server documentation set documents command functionality that may not be compatible with Oracle databases.
