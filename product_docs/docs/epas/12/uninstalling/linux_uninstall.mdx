Note that after uninstalling Advanced Server, the cluster data files remain intact and the service user persists. You may manually remove the cluster `data` and service user from the system.

## Uninstalling on RHEL/OL/AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux

You can use variations of the `rpm, yum` or `dnf` command to remove installed packages. Note that removing a package does not damage the Advanced Server `data` directory.

Include the `-e` option when invoking the `rpm` command to remove an installed package; the command syntax is:

```text
rpm -e <package_name>
```

Where `package_name` is the name of the package that you would like to remove.

You can use the `yum remove` or `dnf remove` command to remove a package installed by `yum` or `dnf`. To remove a package, open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter the command:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum remove <package_name>
    ```

-   On RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8:

    ```text
    dnf remove <package_name>
    ```

Where `package_name` is the name of the package that you would like to remove.

`yum` and RPM will not remove a package that is required by another package. If you attempt to remove a package that satisfies a package dependency, `yum` or RPM will provide a warning.

!!! Note
    In RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8, removing a package also removes all its dependencies that are not required by other packages. To override this default behavior of RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8, you must disable the `clean_requirements_on_remove` parameter in the `/etc/yum.conf` file.

To uninstall Advanced Server and its dependent packages; use the following command:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum remove edb-as12-server*
    ```

-   On RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8:

    ```text
    dnf remove edb-as12-server*
    ```

## Uninstalling on Debian or Ubuntu

-   To uninstall Advanced Server, invoke the following command. The configuration files and data directory remains intact.

    ```text
    apt-get remove edb-as12-server*
    ```

-   To uninstall Advanced Server, configuration files, and data directory, invoke the following command:

    ```text
    apt-get purge edb-as12-server*
    ```

## Uninstalling on SLES:

To uninstall Advanced Server, assume the identity of a root user and invoke the following command:

```text
zypper remove edb-as12-server
```

## Updating Components on a SLES Host:

To update components installed with zypper, use the `zypper update` command.
